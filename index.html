      <h2 class="Canada" id="id">Canada</h2>
      <div class="Canadian">Canada, second largest country in the world in area (after Russia), occupying roughly the northern two-fifths of the continent of North America.Despite Canada’s great size, it is one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries. This fact, coupled with the grandeur of the landscape, has been central to the sense of Canadian national identity. Canada is officially bilingual in English and French, reflecting the country’s history as ground once contested by two of Europe’s great powers. The word Canada is derived from the Huron-Iroquois kanata, meaning a village or settlement.</div>
      <h2 class="America" id="id">US</h2>
      <div class="American" id="id">The United States, a country in North America, is the fourth largest country in the world in area.The national capital is Washington, which
        is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region
        created in 1790.The major characteristic of the United States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low. The country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.

      <h2 class="Mexico" id="id">Mexico</h2>
      <div class="Mexican">
        Mexico, country of southern North America and the third largest country
        in Latin America, after Brazil and Argentina. Mexican society is
        characterized by extremes of wealth and poverty, with a limited middle
        class wedged between an elite cadre of landowners and investors on the
        one hand and masses of rural and urban poor on the other.More than half of the Mexican people live in the centre of the country, whereas vast areas of the arid north and the tropical south are sparsely settled. Migrants from impoverished rural areas have poured into Mexico’s cities, and nearly four-fifths of Mexicans now live in urban areas. Mexico City, the capital, is one of the most populous cities and metropolitan areas in the world. Mexico has experienced a series of economic booms leading to periods of impressive social gains, followed by busts, with significant declines in living standards for the middle and lower classes.
